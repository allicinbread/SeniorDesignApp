# SeniorDesignApp

(This description below is from the Simple Bluetooth Functionality Repo, Since I have successfully combined the new feature to the original application I will change this)

This is the simple bluetooth functionality for the senior design capstone that was written to function with the previous 
microcontroller build. 
Due to the code that was written on the Arduino, the transmission frequency was too quick and could not be displayed properly
on the application. 
Changes are being made to the Arduino code before they can be made to the Android receiver code.

1. Click Clone or download and click zip file
2. Unzip the files and have all of them stored in a folder
3. Download Android studio - https://developer.android.com/studio/install
4. Open Android Studio and navigate to the folder you downloaded all the files
5. There should be a file called "SeniorDesignApp" with the android studio logo that you will be able to open
6. After opening the file you can connect your android device to your computer or install an AVD Manager then press run to run the application

As of right now, the code is 100% functional, and can read temperature being sent from the Arduino with a delay of 10 sec, will be changed in final application to 30 second delay.

The code for the bluetooth feature is being integrated into the initial application. It is being done carefully so the functionality doens't get messed up. Main progress for this week was two meetings. One with sponsor and one with Dr. Nowka last thursday. After that we have been working on final presentation since Professor Nowka want that recorded and sent to him today.  

Research Goals that sponsor asked for was to look in graphing libraries and potentially build a graphing functionality. (Doesn't need to be integrated in the application)

The code for the bluetooth feature was moved to the main application but hasnt been commited to the repo yet because I need to write the write to database functionality into it. It will be completed by next week. Main progress this week was filming for the presentation, refilming after Dr. Nowka's feedback and researching graphing libraries for this Thursday meeting with our sponsor. I found a total of 4 graphing libraries that I will talk to them about thursday.

The code for the bluetooth feature was completely moved to the main application and has been commited to the repo. Main progress for this week has been finalizing the code and also working on the poster. As of today, the readme for the simple bluetooth repo has been moved to the Senior design application repo as the development has been finished.
